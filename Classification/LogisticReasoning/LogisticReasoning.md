# Logistic Reasoning

- ### Predict a categorical dependent variable from a number of independent variables

### Equation -

ln ( p / 1-p ) = b<sub>o</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub>

p = probability of event

The logistic Regression Curve is also called the **Sigmoid Curve**

The regression gives us a probability of something saying yes or no

> P(E) > .5 is taken as 1
> <br>P(E) <  .5 is taken as 0

### Maximum Likelihood

It is the product of all the probabilities of the data

It tells us the next possible outcome and helps us create the sigmoid curve for the graphs.

It iterates through all the datapoints to get the curve with the maximum likelihood and takes it as the best base curve to go for it's predictions

# Case Study -

Working in a car company you are given data on customers who have purchased
your new SUV

Create a model telling you the probability if a person aged X years would buy
the car or not
